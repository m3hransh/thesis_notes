- Plenty of plugins that can extend your workflow
- Local Storage
- Using markdown and easily you can style your notes

## 🧑‍💻How to Add Notes
> [!TIP]
> If you are not familiar with vim key bindings, you can turn it off in `Settings -> Editor -> Vim key bindings`

First thing first use `CTL + P` to open up the command prompt. 
1. `Create new Note (CTL + N)`: use this command to create an empty note and name it with things you find descriptive. Don't scare of long title. The idea is to create as many small notes as you can. If you find yourself writing two much in a file consider creating a new note file.
2. `Templater: Open Insert Template Modal (ALT + I) `: Next thing you need to choose a template. Generally you two choices
	1. **Note entries**: These are notes that based on your thoughts and understanding and you don't use any external sources for summarizing things. In general any concepts or technology you want to write about is note. Then you should use `New` in the modal that opens up
	2. **Seedbox entries**: This could be summarization of something external. checkout this [Tagging](Utility/Tagging.md)
3. Then type in anything you want. Remember to change the status as explained here [Tagging](Utility/Tagging.md).
4. Then you are ready to commit your notes. Remember to create your branch with your names
> [!WARNING]
> Do not add changes in `.obsidian` as this only contains the information about your settings and plugins
